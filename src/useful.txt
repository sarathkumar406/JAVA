Construction Based Dependency Injection– It is achieved when the Spring container invokes a constructor with arguments and each having some dependency on the other class.
Setter-based Dependency Injection- It is achieved when the Spring container calls the setter method of beans after invoking a constructor with no arguments to instantiate the bean.

selection sort pseudo-code
--------------------------
for i = 0 to A.length - 2 
   minIndex = i;
   for j = i+1 to A.length - 1
     if(data[j] < data[minIndex])
         minIndex = j;
     temp = data[minIndex];
     data[minIndex] = data[i];
     data[i] = temp;


Insertioin sort pseudo - code
-----------------------------
for i = 0 to A.length - 1
   current = A[i]
   j = i - 1;
      while j >= 0 && A[j] > current
	A[j+1] = A[j]
	j = j-1
     A[j+1] = current

Bubble sort is very inefficient.

selection sort is better than bubble sort and Runnig time is independent of ordering of elements.

Insertion sort Relativly good for small list and Relatively good for partially sorted lists.


Data Structure
==============
A data Structue (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

WHY
====
- they are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
- They help to manage and organize data.
- They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

Abstract Data Types vs Data Structures
======================================= 
ADT is an abstracttion of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something shuld be implemented or in what programming language.

ADT      Implementation (DS)
===	 ===================
LIST	- Dynamic Array & Linked List

Queue	- Linked List based Queue & Array Based Queue & Satck based Queue

Map	- Tree Map & Hash Map / Hash Table

Vehicle	- Golf Cart & Bicycle & Smart Car


Computational Complexity Analysis
==================================
- How much time does this algorithm need to finish?

- How much space does this algorithm need for its computation?

Big-o Notation
===============





Static Array & DYnamic Array
============================
A static Array is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range 0,n-1.

Indexable
=========
This means that each solt/index in the array can be referenced with a number.

where we can used static array?
- storing and accessing sequential data.
- Temporarily storing objects
- Used by IO routines as buffers.
- Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables.
- Can be used to return multiple values from a function.
- Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to sub-problems.


Spring
======
- Framework for providing comprehensive infrastructural support for developing java Apps.
- Provides the plumbing.
- OOP best practices built in.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

- POJO - Plain Old Java Object.
- JavaBeans - Simple Objects with only setters and getters.
- Spring Beans - POJO's configures in the application context.
- DTO - Bean used to move state between layers.

IOC 
===
- Ioc provides mechanism of dependency Injection.
- ApplicationContext wraps the BeanFactory, which servi the beans to the runtime of the application.
- Spring boot provides the auto-configuration of the ApplicationContext.

Why SPring boot
---------------
- Supports rapid development.
- Removes boilerplate of application setup.
- Many uses.
- Cloud native support, but also traditional.

Key components
--------------
- Embedded Tomcat (or Others )
- Auto-configuration of ApplicationContext.
- Automatic servlet mappings.
- Embedded database support and hibernate/JPA dialet.
- Automatic controller mappings.
